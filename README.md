# Zigma

Tool to enhance my work in data analysis field. 
Tool is focused on supporting me in Extracting, Transformation, Loading of the data.


## Description:

I am using lots of python code to handle with data but I would like to code more in C# due to get better know of this language.
That is why Zigma has born.
